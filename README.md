In this project, we set up a simple ETL pipeline to centralize your data and make analysis easy.

The original data comes in json files, so we have developed a jupyter notebook to have a playing field to understand it, manipulate it, and store it in a postgres database.
After that, we used that experience to create a Python script for the pipeline to process all the information.
